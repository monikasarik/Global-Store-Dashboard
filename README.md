ðŸš€ Power BI Global Store Dashboard 

I recently created an interactive Power BI dashboard for a Global Store dataset, and Iâ€™m excited to share it! This project was a hands-on exercise in transforming raw data into meaningful insights for business decision-making.
What I used:
1.Power BI for visualizations and dashboard design
2.Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
3.DAX for custom calculations and metrics

ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Highlights:
1.Slicers for dynamic filtering (region, category, segment)
2.Cards to display key KPIs like Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity
3.Pie & Donut Charts to visualize category and sub-category distributions
4.Map Visuals to show global sales performance by region
Interactive and clean layout for ease of data exploration

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:
 This project helped strengthen my skills in data modeling, visual storytelling, and user-focused design. Itâ€™s incredible how well-designed visuals can unlock insights that drive strategic decisions.
